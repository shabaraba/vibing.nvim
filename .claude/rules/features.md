# Features

## Auto-Resume on Usage Limit

When a turn is rejected because the plan's usage limit is exhausted, vibing.nvim can park the chat
and send a single continuation message once the limit resets. Opt-in via
`agent.auto_resume_on_limit.enabled` (default `false` — it spends tokens unattended).

Detection merges three signals in `lua/vibing/core/utils/rate_limit.lua`: the CLI's
`rate_limit_event` stream line (the **only** source of `resetsAt`), the `StopFailure` hook filtered
to `error_type = rate_limit` (confirms the turn died, no timestamp), and the error text as a
fallback. None of these payload shapes is officially documented, so every field is optional and a
schema change degrades the feature instead of breaking the stream.

Pending resumes persist to `.vibing/pending-resume.json` and are re-armed on `setup()`, since a
five-hour reset usually outlives the Neovim session. Safeguards: `max_retries` (default 1) per
limit hit, never overwriting an unsent `## User` message, and an 8-day sanity ceiling on the reset
timestamp. Concurrently parked chats all fire at once by design. See `docs/configuration.md` →
"Auto-Resume on Usage Limit".

**Implementation:** `application/chat/auto_resume.lua` (scheduler),
`infrastructure/storage/pending_resume.lua` (persistence),
`infrastructure/rpc/handlers/rate_limit.lua` (StopFailure receiver), `bin/hooks/stop-failure.sh`.

## Message Timestamps

Chat messages include timestamps in their headers (`## 2025-12-28 14:30:00 User`) for chronology
and search — `/2025-12-28` in Neovim, or `grep "## 2025-12-28" .vibing/chat/*.md` across chat
files. Legacy headers without timestamps (`## User`, `## Assistant`) remain fully supported. User
timestamps are recorded when the message is sent (`<CR>`); Assistant timestamps are recorded when
the response begins (`on_done` callback). Timestamps use the local system timezone (Lua's
`os.date()`).

Implemented in `lua/vibing/utils/timestamp.lua`: `create_header(role, timestamp)`,
`extract_role(line)`, `has_timestamp(line)`, `extract_timestamp(line)`, `is_header(line)`.

## AskUserQuestion Support

Claude's `AskUserQuestion` tool renders as plain markdown in the chat buffer instead of a native
prompt, so the user can answer with ordinary Vim editing:

```markdown
Which database should we use?

1. PostgreSQL
2. MySQL
3. SQLite

Please answer the question and press `<CR>` to send.
```

Single-select questions render as a numbered list (`1. 2. 3.`); multi-select questions render as a
bullet list (`- - -`). The user deletes unwanted options with standard Vim commands (`dd`, etc.)
and sends the remainder with `<CR>`; Claude receives the edited list as a normal user message — no
special Promise/state handling is required.

**Implementation:** the Agent Wrapper sends an `insert_choices` event and denies the tool; the
choices are inserted as plain markdown (numbered for `multiSelect: false`, bulleted for `true`).
